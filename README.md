# IPL-Pie-in-the-Sky-project
This project is a detailed database management case study for the "Pie-in-the-Sky" IPL match bidding application. It allows users to place bets on IPL matches, predict winners, and track leaderboard rankings. The project demonstrates the application of SQL to design, manage, and query a relational database to extract valuable insights.
- Features:
  * Database Schema: Developed multiple interrelated tables to represent users, teams, matches, stadiums, bidding details, and tournament statistics.
  * Dynamic Point System: Implemented a flexible point allocation system based on match outcomes and bidding accuracy.
  * Insights Extraction: Created SQL queries to analyze match statistics, bidder performance, and leaderboard standings.
  *Trigger Implementation: Demonstrated the use of SQL triggers for automating data backup.
- Database Structure:
  The project employs a relational schema, featuring key tables such as:
  * IPL_User: Stores user credentials and roles (Admin or Bidder).
  * IPL_Team: Contains details about IPL teams, including their cities and names.
  * IPL_Match: Tracks match schedules, results, and venues.
  * IPL_Bidding_Details: Records bids placed by users for various matches.
  * IPL_Team_Standings: Offers insights into team performance throughout tournaments.
    Additional tables for players, stadiums, tournaments, and other entities provide a comprehensive representation of the IPL bidding ecosystem.
- SQL Query Examples:
  This project includes SQL queries to address complex use cases, such as:
  * Displaying the percentage of wins for each bidder.
  * Calculating the total matches played, won, and lost by each team.
  * Extracting top-performing players based on wickets taken.
  * Identifying top and bottom bidders based on points.
  * Analyzing team performance trends based on match venues.
- Future Scope:
  * Advanced Analytics: Incorporate more sophisticated analytical queries for deeper insights.
  * Stored Procedures: Develop stored procedures for repetitive tasks.
  * Schema Expansion: Extend the database schema to include additional IPL-related data points.
